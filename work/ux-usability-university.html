              University websites in developed countries are usually
              well-developed with usability in mind. The same cannot be said for
              developing countries. This is supported by more research done in
              developing countries than developed ones. There are many research
              done using undergraduate and graduate students. Lacking research
              is available for students interested in admitting to a university
              or are going to graduate high school.

              <strong>usability of three Malaysian university websites</strong>.
              A <strong>design with improvements</strong> was proposed in
              reference to one of the three websites, then compared.

              Malaysian universities websites often suffer from bad usability. A
              research done by Zurida et al. (2020) investigated five private
              university websites and found common usability issues within.

              Coupled with the poor digital literacy of youths in Malaysia due
              to lack of push on relevant IT courses by the government, these
              youths will find difficulties in querying necessary information
              for admission such as scholarship, programmes, fees, etc.

              Two of the three websites had lower quartile rankings (HELP under
              Poor and Xiamen OK) as designated by the SUS score quartiles.
              Participants had a difficult time solving tasks even though they
              were understood clearly. Time taken for each task can range from 3
              seconds to 180 seconds (the set upper limit). The last website was
              under the good quartile. However, the results from ISO 9126-4 were
              still poor.

              There was an improvement on the proposed over the reference
              website. It fell under the good quartile. The largest difference
              seen was the time taken to accomplish each task, from 2 seconds to
              125 seconds. Task completion rate and satisfaction improved
              dramatically.

              This study has several flaws. To increase accuracy, future
              research could use metrics from heatmaps, mouse clicks and so on.
              This study should be repeated multiple times while filling more
              content within the design to investigate the significance in the
              number of pages, information, etc.
